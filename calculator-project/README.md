# Calculator Project

This project is a simple web-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It consists of an HTML file for the structure, a JavaScript file for the logic, and a CSS file for minimal styling.

## Project Structure

```
calculator-project
├── src
│   ├── calculator.html      # HTML structure for the calculator
│   ├── calculator.js        # JavaScript functions for arithmetic operations
│   └── styles
│       └── calculator.css   # Minimal CSS styles for the calculator
└── README.md                # Documentation for the project
```

## Usage

1. Open `calculator.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter numbers in the input fields.
3. Click on the arithmetic operation buttons to perform calculations.
4. The result will be displayed on the screen.

## Notes

- The project uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Ensure that all files are in the correct directory structure for the calculator to function properly.

## Copilot's Output

Copilot's output was helpful for generating the logic of the arithmetic functions in `calculator.js`, ensuring that the calculations are performed correctly. However, the layout may require additional manual adjustments for optimal styling in `calculator.html` and `calculator.css`.
